# Frogger Arcarde Game Project

## Introduction

This project is part of the Udacity's Front-end Web Development Nanodegree courses that I took during 2017/11-2018/5. I started with a given game engine and added Javascipt objects to make the game fully functional.

## How The Game Works (from Udacity project instructions)

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

## How to play

Open the index.html page in the browser. Move the player using the keyboard to start the game. Happy froggering!
